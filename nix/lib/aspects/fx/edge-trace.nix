# edge-trace.nix — the LEGACY end-state re-derivation of the pipeline's delivery
# decisions as a normalized, stably-sorted edge list. As of Task 18 this is NO
# LONGER the live trace: the live `edgeTrace` is the CAPTURED production edge
# object (resolve.nix — its fold-ordered provides+routes come straight from the
# production materializeUnified folds). This `extractEdgeTrace` is retained and
# surfaced as `legacyEdgeTrace` ONLY as the legacy arm of the oracle≡production
# DIFFERENTIAL (templates/ci/.../fx-oracle-production-differential.nix): it
# re-derives the edge set from END-STATE, INCLUDING the spawn `rewalk` arm (the
# undercount the production object eliminates) and the dedup-`suppressed` route
# twins (which production never folds). It was the migration oracle for the
# Phase-2 port (spec 2026-06-12 §3a); post-Task-18 its job is to prove, by diff,
# that production dropped exactly the rewalk undercount + suppressed twins.
#
# All edge kinds (default folds, simple + complex routes, provides, spawns,
# instantiates) render through the SAME constructors production materializes
# through (edges/default.nix, edges/route.nix, edges/provides.nix,
# edges/instantiate.nix). The ONE residual annotation is `sourceVia = "unresolved"`
# for complex-forward (synthesize) edges: the collected-else-rewalk source choice
# is materialization-time path-dependent, so the trace records identity, not the
# resolved branch (spec §8; see routeEdges). This stays "unresolved" PERMANENTLY —
# it is correct, not a convergence-pending approximation.
