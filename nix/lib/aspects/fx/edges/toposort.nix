# toposort.nix — the GENERAL record-level delivery-edge toposort (Task 16).
# Generalizes route.nix's per-route `topoSort` (which keyed deps only on
# sourceScopeId, the known blind spot) to a cell-model toposort over the UNIFIED
# edge set: cross-kind (provides/route/synthesize/default-fold/instantiate),
# cross-field, cross-root. A producer that WRITES a (scope,class) cell must fire
# before any edge that READS that cell.
#
# CELL MODEL (B15 proof). Producers WRITE; only the final-extraction merge,
# synthesize, and instantiate edges READ produced cells. Provides + simple routes
# read FROZEN phase-1 inputs, so they depend on NOTHING.
#
#   writeCell(edge):
#     target {root;class}  → cell (target.root, target.class). Covers EVERY
#                            producer: provides nest, route nest/merge,
#                            appendToParent (constructor already set
#                            target.root=parent), synthesize. No special-case.
#     target {output}      → writes nothing readable (terminal instantiate).
#
#   readCells(edge):
#     merge + annotations.collectedScopes  → { (sid, target.class) : sid ∈
#                            collectedScopes } — the per-root final extraction
#                            reads every subtree-scope bucket at its class.
#     synthesize source     → (target.root, fromClass) ∪ (rootName, fromClass) ∪
#                            the FLAT aggregate of fromClass: i.e. EVERY producer
#                            of fromClass at ANY scope (route.nix:568 reads the
#                            flat acc.classImports.${fromClass}). Modeled as
#                            "depends on all writers of fromClass".
#     collected source + target {output} (instantiate) → (source.collected.scope,
#                            source.collected.class) — the host subtree bucket;
#                            depends on that host's final-extraction merge.
#     anything else (provides / simple route — collected source, no
#                            collectedScopes, root target) → {} (frozen phase-1
#                            inputs, B15). The presence of collectedScopes is what
#                            distinguishes a READING merge from a producing one.
#
# Ambiguity rule: any edge shape not matched above defaults to readCells = {} —
# a pure producer. Conservative: never invents a false cycle.
#
# The DAG is built over INDICES (edge records carry functions and are not
# comparable / hashable); the cell match is a pure record inspection (no content
# eval). Kahn toposort with a loud cycle throw mirroring route.nix's message.
