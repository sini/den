# Shared state mutation helpers for scoped pipeline fields.
#
# Each field is stored as a thunk `_: attrset` so that nix-effects'
# deepSeq on state doesn't force all fields eagerly.  However, we
# must prevent closure *chains*: if each write wraps the previous
# thunk, reading the final value costs O(N) and N reads costs O(N²).
# Fix: eagerly materialise the previous value with builtins.seq before
# wrapping in the new thunk, so each read is O(1).
