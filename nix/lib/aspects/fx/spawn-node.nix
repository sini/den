# Node-spawn primitive.

# A spawned node is an independent resolution node spawned from a parent
# (host) scope, threaded with the parent pipeline's resolved scope-tree state
# (host + ALL siblings) so its OWN assemblePipes pass re-derives
# inherited/collected pipe values with full fleet visibility. den-hoag: a
# `spawn` with one read-only inherited edge (neededBy the parent's resolved
# state) — parallel-schedulable, not a sequential route fold.
