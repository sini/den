# Shared subtree walk + key-dedup for the delivery half.
#
# One walk implementation backs every "scope + descendants" collection in the
# pipeline (default fold, route subtree collect, per-host re-walk, spawn final
# extraction) and the edge-trace oracle, so production and oracle can never
# diverge. The `isolated` argument is REQUIRED at every call site: there is no
# default. Two live callers need the isolation-BLIND variant (`isolated = {}`)
# and they are NOT the same call site (census #6/#10): the per-host re-walk's
# sub-phase collect, and spawn-node's final extraction. Defaulting `isolated`
# would silently collapse the blind/aware split the census proved deliberate.

  # Scope IDs in `root`'s subtree. `root` is ALWAYS included: isolation gates
  # crossing INTO a descendant, not collecting AT the root. `isolated` is a
  # `{ <sid> = bool; }` map; `isolated = {}` gives the isolation-blind variant.
