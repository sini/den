          Query whether an aspect is structurally present in this entity's
          resolved aspect tree.

          Usage:
            host.hasAspect <facter>                         # primary class
            host.hasAspect.forClass "nixos" <facter>        # explicit class
            host.hasAspect.forAnyClass <facter>             # union across classes

          Safe to call from inside class-config module bodies
          (`nixos = ...`, `homeManager = ...`) and from lazy positions
          inside aspect functor bodies. NOT safe to use for deciding an
          aspect's `includes` list — that's cyclic; use meta.adapter +
          excludeAspect / oneOfAspects for structural decisions instead.

        description = ''
          The flat list of all resolved aspect nodes on this entity (every
          depth), each the resolved node augmented with:
            .identity     # base FQN, ctx-stripped — e.g. "roles/workstation"
            .identityKey  # full unique key incl {ctxId} (distinguishes anons)
            .isNamed      # false for anonymous aspects

          Each node also retains its `.name`, `.meta`, and `.includes` (its
          resolved subtree), so callers can inspect, navigate, and re-include
          it. Excludes the entity root and excluded/tombstoned aspects;
          anonymous aspects are included.

          Same cyclic caveat as `hasAspect`: do not use to decide an aspect's
          own `includes`. Reading it post-resolution (module bodies, batteries)
          is safe.
