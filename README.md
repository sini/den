# den — Aspect-oriented, Context-driven Nix

**Write a feature once. Run it on every host, user, and platform you have — and share it with anyone, flake or not.**

Den turns Nix configuration into composable **features** instead of per-host piles of modules. A Den _aspect_ is a plain function: give it context (your hosts and users) and it returns configuration for every Nix class it touches — `nixos`, `darwin`, `homeManager`, `hjem`, or a class you invent.

```nix
# An aspect is a function of context that returns
# configuration for many Nix classes at once.
den.aspects.gaming = { host, user }: {
  nixos       = { pkgs, ... }: { programs.steam.enable = true; };
  darwin      = { pkgs, ... }: { /* ... */ };
  homeManager = { pkgs, ... }: { /* ... */ };

  includes = [ den.aspects.performance ];   # aspects compose
  provides.emulation = { nixos = { /* ... */ }; };  # and nest
};
```

That one idea — **a feature as a function** — is what makes the rest possible.

## What Den makes possible

- **One feature, everywhere, in one place.** Stop scattering a single concern across separate `nixos`, `darwin`, and `homeManager` files. An aspect holds all of it together.
- **Reuse across hosts, users — and across projects.** Share aspects between machines, between people, and between _flake and non-flake_ setups, without forcing everyone to download each other's inputs.
- **No `mkIf` / `enable` clutter.** The shape of the context _is_ the condition — a function that asks for `{ host, user }` simply doesn't run where there's no user. Conditionals disappear.
- **Hosts shape their users, users shape their hosts.** Cross-entity configuration flows both ways, without coupling them together.
- **Add a capability in one line; remove it by deleting that line.** Hosts just pick the aspects they want.
- **Bring your own classes and whole pipelines.** Custom Nix classes, machine fleets, MicroVM guests, terranix, standalone neovim — if you can walk it as data, Den can configure it.

## Principles

Four concepts, one job each:

- **Entity** — _what exists_: a host, user, or home.
- **Aspect** — _what it does_: a feature, spanning Nix classes.
- **Policy** — _how entities relate_: topology and routing between them.
- **Quirk** — _structured data aspects share_, without coupling.

**Feature-first, not host-first.** Traditional setups start from hosts and push modules down; Den [flips that](https://den.denful.dev/explanation/core-principles/) — features are primary, hosts just select them.

**Den embraces your Nix.** With or without flakes, flake-parts, or home-manager. Zero dependencies. Every part is optional and replaceable — Den works with the setup you already have, and gets out of the way.

## Try it now

```console
# a MicroVM
nix run github:denful/den?dir=templates/microvm#runnable-microvm

# a standalone neovim
nix run github:denful/den?dir=templates/nvf-standalone#my-neovim

# a qemu VM
nix run github:denful/den
```

> I'm super impressed with den so far, I'm excited to try out some new patterns that Unify couldn't easily do.\
> — `@quasigod`, author of [Unify](https://codeberg.org/quasigod/unify)

> Massive work you did here!\

> Thanks for the awesome library and the support for non-flakes… it's positively brilliant! I really hope this gets wider adoption.\
> — `@vczf`, at [`#den-lib:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#den-lib:matrix.org)

> Den is a playground for some very advanced concepts… some of its ideas will play a role in future Nix areas. There are some raw diamonds in Den.\
