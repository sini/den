          ## Scope Topology

          The scope tree shows how den organizes entities hierarchically.
          Each node is a scope — a context in which aspects and policies are
          evaluated. Child scopes inherit their parent's context bindings.

          In this fleet, the tree is: flake → fleet → environment → host → user.
          Environment and host scopes are created by policies that walk the
          `fleet.environments` and `den.hosts` registries. User scopes are
          created by access policies that match registry users by group membership.

      policyResolutionSection =

          source = stripFrontmatter (rc.render.toPolicyResolutionMapMermaid fleetCapture);
        in
        ''
          ## Policy Resolution

          Policies are functions that run at each scope and produce effects:
          resolving child entities, providing configuration, or collecting data.
          This diagram shows which policies fire at each scope level and what
          they produce.

          The arrows show the resolution chain — how `to-fleet` creates the
          fleet scope, `fleet-to-envs` fans out environments, `env-to-hosts`
          walks hosts, and `env-users`/`host-users` resolve registry users
          onto their granted hosts.

          source = stripFrontmatter (rc.render.toPipeFlowMermaid fleetCapture);
        in
        ''
          ## Pipe Flow

          Pipes (quirks declared with `pipe.collect`) allow sibling hosts to
          share data. Each host that includes an aspect emitting a quirk
          contributes to a collected dataset available to peers in the same
          environment.

          This diagram shows two pipes in the fleet:
          - **http-backends** — nginx aspects emit backend addresses, collected
            by the haproxy aspect on `lb-prod` to generate load balancer config.
          - **host-addrs** — every host emits its address, collected by the
            hostfile aspect to generate `/etc/hosts` entries.

          ## Pipe Sequence

          A sequence diagram showing the emit → collect flow for each pipe.
          Each host that participates in a pipe is shown as a lifeline, with
          arrows indicating data flow direction.

          > **Note:** The ordering of emitters in this diagram is arbitrary —
          > `pipe.collect` gathers all peer emissions as an unordered list.
          > The sequence is for visualization only; there is no guaranteed
          > evaluation order between sibling hosts.

        ''
          ## Aspect Namespace

          The global registry of all declared aspects and their hierarchy.
          Each node is an aspect — a reusable unit of configuration that can
          be included by hosts or users. Edges show the `includes` relationship:
          `lb-prod` includes `haproxy` and `hostfile`, web servers include
          `nginx` and `hostfile`.

        | Concept | Description |
        |---------|-------------|
        | **Scope** | A context (node in the scope tree) where aspects and policies evaluate. Scopes inherit parent bindings. |
        | **Policy** | A function that fires at a scope and produces effects: resolving child entities, providing config, or collecting data. |
        | **Aspect** | A reusable unit of configuration. Aspects emit class modules (NixOS, Home Manager) and quirk data. |
        | **Pipe / Quirk** | A data channel between sibling scopes. One aspect emits a quirk, siblings collect it via `pipe.collect`. |
        | **Entity** | A named scope with identity: fleet, environment, host, or user. Created by `resolve.to`. |
        | **Registry** | A typed attrset of entity definitions. `fleet.environments` and `den.users.registry` are registries. |
        | **Battery** | A reusable include that generates per-entity aspect identities (e.g., `define-user`, `ssh-keys`). |

            # Fleet Demo

            A multi-host NixOS fleet managed by den,
            demonstrating environment-based topology, cross-host data sharing, and
            policy-driven user access from a centralized registry.

            ## What This Builds

            Four NixOS hosts across two environments:

            | Host | Environment | Role |
            |------|-------------|------|
            | `lb-prod` | prod | HAProxy load balancer — collects backend addresses from peers |
            | `web-prod-1` | prod | Nginx web server — emits backend address for load balancing |
            | `web-prod-2` | prod | Nginx web server — emits backend address for load balancing |
            | `web-staging` | staging | Nginx web server — staging environment |

            Each host gets a complete `nixosConfiguration` with networking, service
            config, and user accounts — all derived from the same set of aspects and
            policies.

            ## Custom Entity Types

            Den has built-in entity kinds (host, user), but this demo defines two
            additional entity types entirely in user space — no framework changes
            required.

            ### Environments

            `environments.nix` defines a custom `environment` entity type by setting
            `den.schema.environment.isEntity = true` and creating a typed option
            `fleet.environments` whose submodule imports `den.schema.environment`.
            Each environment carries a `domain-name` and is registered as an instance:

            ```nix
            fleet.environments = {
              prod    = { domain-name = "example.com"; };
              staging = { domain-name = "staging.example.com"; };
            };
            ```

            The host schema is extended with `environment` and `addr` options via
            `den.schema.host.imports`, so every host declares which environment it
            belongs to.

            ### Users as Entities

            `users.nix` promotes users to real entities (`den.schema.user.isEntity = true`)
            and extends the user schema with `email`, `groups`, and `ssh-keys` options.
            The registry type imports `den.schema.user` so each entry is a proper user
            entity with `userName`, `classes`, `aspect` — not a plain attrset.

            ## Policy-Driven Scope Tree

            Den's default policies walk `den.hosts` and create host scopes directly
            under `flake-system`. This demo replaces that with a custom scope tree:

            ```
            flake → fleet → environment → host → user
            ```

            This is built by a chain of policies in `policies/fleet.nix`, each firing
            at a specific scope level and resolving child entities:

            | Policy | Fires at | Resolves | Mechanism |
            |--------|----------|----------|-----------|
            | `to-fleet` | flake | fleet | `resolve.to "fleet"` — creates a single fleet entity |
            | `fleet-to-envs` | fleet | environments | `resolve.to "environment"` — one per `fleet.environments` entry |
            | `env-to-hosts` | environment | hosts | `resolve.to "host"` — filters `den.hosts` by matching `host.environment` |
            | `env-users` | host | users | `resolve.to "user"` — filters `den.users.registry` by environment group grant |
            | `host-users` | host | users | `resolve.to "user"` — filters `den.users.registry` by host-specific group grant |

            Each `resolve.to` call creates a named child scope. The entity's context
            bindings (`host`, `user`, `environment`, etc.) are available to all aspects
            and policies that fire within that scope.

            ### Disabling Default Policies

            Den's core provides built-in policies for common patterns. This demo
            disables two of them to take full control of the scope tree:

            - **`den.policies.system-to-os-outputs`** and **`den.policies.system-to-hm-outputs`** are
              excluded from `den.schema.flake-system` — the fleet policies handle host
              instantiation explicitly via `den.lib.policy.instantiate`, so the default
              per-system output walk is unnecessary.

            - **`den.policies.host-to-users`** is excluded from `den.schema.host` — this
              core policy walks `host.users` (inline user definitions) and resolves them
              via `resolve.shared`. Since this demo resolves users from the external
              registry via `resolve.to "user"`, the default policy would be a no-op but
              is excluded for clarity.

            ## User Registry and Group-Based Access

            Users are defined once in `den.users.registry` with identity metadata:

            ```nix
            den.users.registry = {
              alice = {
                email = "alice@example.com";
                groups = [ "admin" ];
                ssh-keys = [ "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3... alice@workstation" ];
              };
              bob = {
                email = "bob@example.com";
                groups = [ "deploy" ];
                ssh-keys = [ "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3... bob@laptop" ];
              };
            };
            ```

            Access is controlled by `fleet.user-access`, which maps group names to
            environments or specific hosts:

            ```nix
            fleet.user-access.by-environment = {
              prod    = { groups = [ "admin" ]; };
              staging = { groups = [ "admin" "deploy" ]; };
            };
            ```

            The `env-users` policy fires at each host scope, looks up the access
            grant for `host.environment`, and filters the registry for users whose
            `groups` intersect the granted set. Each match becomes a `resolve.to "user"`
            call, creating a user scope on that host.

            | User | Groups | Prod (grants admin) | Staging (grants admin + deploy) |
            |------|--------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
            | alice | admin | yes | yes |
            | bob | deploy | no | yes |

            The `host-users` policy provides the same mechanism scoped to individual
            hosts via `fleet.user-access.by-host`, allowing per-host overrides on top
            of environment-level grants.

            The `ssh-keys` aspect fires in every user scope and sets
            `users.users.''${user.userName}.openssh.authorizedKeys.keys` from
            `user.ssh-keys`. Because user scopes only exist on hosts where access
            was granted, keys are provisioned exactly where they should be — nowhere
            else.

            ## Pipes and Cross-Host Data Sharing

            Pipes allow sibling hosts within the same environment to share data
            declaratively. They are built on den's quirk system.

            ### Declaring Pipes

            `policies/pipes.nix` declares two quirks as pipes:

            ```nix
            den.quirks.http-backends = {
              description = "HTTP backend addresses for load balancer aggregation";
            };
            den.quirks.host-addrs = {
              description = "Host address entries for /etc/hosts generation";
            };
            ```

            Each host includes `pipe.collect` policies that gather these quirks
            from all peers in the same environment:

            ```nix
            den.policies.collect-backends = { host, ... }: [
              (pipe.from "http-backends" [ (pipe.collect ({ host, ... }: true)) ])
            ];
            ```

            ### Emitting and Consuming

            Aspects participate in pipes by defining a key matching the quirk name.

            **Emitting** — the `nginx` aspect emits an `http-backends` entry:

            ```nix
            den.aspects.nginx = {
              nixos = { ... }: { services.nginx.enable = true; /* ... */ };
              http-backends = { host, ... }: { inherit (host) addr; port = host.httpPort; };
            };
            ```

            **Consuming** — the `haproxy` aspect receives the collected list:

            ```nix
            den.aspects.haproxy = {
              nixos = { http-backends, lib, ... }:
                let
                  backendLines = lib.imap1 (i: b:
                    "  server backend''${toString i} ''${b.addr}:''${toString b.port} check"
                  ) http-backends;
                in { /* haproxy config using backendLines */ };
            };
            ```

            The `http-backends` argument in the haproxy NixOS module is automatically
            populated by `pipe.collect` with entries from all sibling hosts that emit
            the `http-backends` quirk. Adding a new web server host to `prod` automatically
            adds it to haproxy's backend list — no manual wiring.

            The same pattern is used for `host-addrs`: every host emits its IP/hostname
            pair, and the `hostfile` aspect collects them to generate `/etc/hosts`.

            ## Usage

            Build a host configuration:

            ```bash
            nix build .#nixosConfigurations.lb-prod.config.system.build.toplevel
            ```

            Regenerate diagrams:

            ```bash
            nix run .#write-diagrams
            ```
          ''
          "---"
          ""
          "# Diagrams"
          ""
          "The following visualizations are generated from the fleet's actual"
          "aspect-resolution pipeline. They show the same topology from different"
          "angles."
