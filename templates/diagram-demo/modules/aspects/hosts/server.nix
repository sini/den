# Server host: relay role with compound constraint composition.
#
# Demonstrates three constraint patterns in one host:
#   1. exclude — remove a specific provider sub-aspect (nginx-exporter)
#   2. filterBy — remove all aspects from a provider prefix (monitoring.*)
#   3. composition — multiple constraints via handleWith list
#
# The relay role includes server + mail, and server includes monitoring
# with sub-providers (node-exporter, nginx-exporter, alerting). The
# constraints prune monitoring providers from the resolution tree.
