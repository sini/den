# Acceptance for denful/den#609: a host-scope aspect must NOT leak homeManager
# content into its users' HM evaluation. The formal rule (class-local emission):
# a parametric aspect at scope S (entity kind K_S) destructuring entity-kind K_a
#   - K_a in ctx          → bind once at S
#   - K_a descendant of S → fan out over S's K_a-children, EMIT AT S
#   - neither             → misplaced → whole aspect inert, silently
# Emission is always class-local to the EMITTING scope. The host scope resolves
# nixos but NOT homeManager, so homeManager content in a host-scope aspect is
# inert — it never reaches users. This is the #609 fix: homeManager must reach
# users only via a to-users policy, never a bare host-scope include.
