# Regression: navigating through a MULTI-DEF nested namespace key strips
# aspect identity from its children.
#
# aspectContentType's multi-def branch returns `subForwarded // { __provider;
# __contentValues; }` — the colliding key itself is tagged, but its forwarded
# children are raw attrsets with no `name` and no `__provider`. wrapChild then
# falls through nameless and children.nix renames the child to
# `<parent>/<anon>:<idx>`, so the same aspect included via two paths gets two
# identities: emit-class dedup fails and the class content double-applies
# (equal-priority option conflicts for scalar options, duplicated entries for
# list options) when the content re-emits in a spawned user resolution.
#
# Real-world shape: gpg.nix and ssh.nix both define children of
# den.aspects.apps.dev.security (multi-def at `dev`), and
# apps.dev.security.gpg is included by both roles.dev and roles.dev-gui —
# pinentry.package then gets two equal-priority definitions in the user's
# home-manager config.
#
# The single-def path is unaffected (annotatedMerged tags those children),
# which is why 3-level aspects like apps.shell.foo dedup fine.
