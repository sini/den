# B′ cross-host peer-config divergence witness (§A #8/#2/#7).
#
# `hostConfigs` (re-entry B′, resolve.nix) builds each peer host's full nixos
# config for cross-host config-dependent pipe-thunk resolution (assemble-pipes
# resolveEntry reads `config = hostConfigs.${sourceScopeId}`). Pre-fix B′ built
# those configs over the RAW scopeContexts (§A #8) and RAW (undrained) class
# imports (§A #2/#7) — so a peer whose config CONSUMES a pipe value (or
# depends on a deferred include) diverged from its real instantiate output
# (variant B): the pipe value was never injected / the include never drained, so
# the peer config threw `attribute 'feat' missing` instead of resolving.
#
# Witness shape (the §A probe template, minimised to the natural host topology):
#   - a pipe-consuming peer aspect `needs-feat.nixos = { feat, ... }:
#     { networking.domain = builtins.head feat; }` — reads the `feat` quirk value
#     from its context. `feat` is a host-scope pipe (pipe.for → [ host.name ]),
#     resolved by assemblePipes, NOT present in raw scopeContexts;
#   - a cross-host `collectAll` config-thunk `host-marks = { config, ... }:
#     [ "d-${config.networking.domain}" ]` reading each peer's config — this is
#     what forces hostConfigs (B′) to build the peer configs.
#
# Only igloo COLLECTS (asymmetric on purpose): a mutual collectAll (both hosts
# reading each other's config) is a genuine inter-config cycle no pass can break.
# Both hosts EMIT a host-marks value, so igloo's collectAll builds BOTH configs.
#
# Before the fix: igloo's collectAll reads iceberg's `config.networking.domain`
# via hostConfigs.${iceberg} (B′), built over raw contexts → `feat` unbound →
# `feat missing`. After the fix (B′ over augmentedScopeContextsNoCfg +
# drainedForHostConfigs): the peer config matches variant B and resolves.
#
# Control: a cross-host thunk reading a NON-pipe config field (hostName, set from
# the host record) resolves under B′ regardless — isolating the pipe/deferred
# injection as the cause.
