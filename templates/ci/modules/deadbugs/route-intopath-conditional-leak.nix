# Two related bugs in simple `policy.route`, surfaced by a guarded route that
# uses `intoPath` (the forward-style target-path name).
#
# Bug 1 (route/wrap.nix `guardModule`): a guarded route whose guard is false
# crashed with
#   error: The option `_file' does not exist. Definition values:
#     { _type = "if"; condition = false; content = "foo@igloo"; }
# because the raw collector module `{ key; _file; imports }` was merged under
# `config` (metadata mis-read as options) and gated with `mkIf` (which still
# requires the target option to exist). Fixed by gating with `optionalAttrs`
# (matching the forward path) and recursing into structural imports.
#
# Bug 2 (policy-effects.nix `route`): `intoPath` was silently dropped — only
# `path` was read — so content landed at the class root instead of nesting.
# Fixed by accepting `intoPath` as the public alias for `path`.
