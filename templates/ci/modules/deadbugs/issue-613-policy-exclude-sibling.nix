# #613 analog for POLICY-NAME exclusion (dispatch-policies / policy-schema late
# filter). Sibling parity: one host excluding a POLICY must not suppress a sibling
# host that includes+fires it. Companion to issue-613-exclude-sibling-isolation
# (aspect-content excludes). Both flavors now route through scopedConstraintsFor
# (entity-scoped + schema-broadcast), so the fleet-wide leak is gone while
# schema-tier (den.schema.KIND.excludes) excludes still broadcast.
