# #613 analog for EXCLUDES — sibling-scope isolation of the constraint registry.
#
# #613 fixed sibling leakage in the conditional-guard hasAspect (the pathSet was
# fleet-wide). This verifies the EXCLUDE path (the constraint registry, applied at
# check-constraint during the tree walk) has the SAME per-entity isolation: one
# host excluding an aspect must NOT suppress a SIBLING host that includes it, and
# vice-versa — regardless of host eval order (iceberg vs igloo).
#
# Mirrors github.com/tschan/den-hasaspect-bug modules/bug.nix (the `bogus` +
# `working` pair). Both must pass: an include on host X delivers the aspect to X
# even when a sibling Y excludes it.
