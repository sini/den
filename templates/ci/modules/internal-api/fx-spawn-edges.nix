# fx-spawn-edges suite — the spawn materializer (assembleSpawnSubtree) now ALSO
# surfaces its constructed delivery-edge set (Task 16). The spawn fold returns
# `{ imports; edges; }`: `imports` is byte-identical to before (consumers read
# only it), and `edges` is the spawn's default-fold merge edge(s) ++ its OWN
# provides edges ++ the RE-APPLIED mergedSpawnRoutes route edges (simple +
# complex), built via the same fold-independent constructors the read-only
# oracle consumes.
#
# Two checks:
#   1. a FOCUSED unit assertion driving assembleSpawnSubtree directly with stub
#      phase primitives + a hand-built mergedSpawnRoutes — asserts the surfaced
#      `.edges` carries the re-applied route edge (the kind the OLD spawn arm,
#      a single rewalk edge, omitted) AND that `.imports` is preserved.
#   2. a topology sanity check — a real spawn-bearing config (a host with a
#      home-manager user) resolves and delivers content, proving the surfacing
#      did not break spawn delivery.
