# delivery-edges suite — snapshot fixtures + rule-corollary tests for the
# PRODUCTION delivery-edge object (resolveWithPaths .edgeTrace, Task 18.2). As of
# Task 18.2 `edgeTrace` is the production edge object: its fold-ordered
# provides+routes portion is CAPTURED from the production materializeUnified folds
# (not re-derived), with constructor-built default-fold + instantiate edges and the
# SURFACED spawn / per-host edges. This means (vs the legacy re-derivation, now
# `legacyEdgeTrace`): the dedup-suppressed route twins are ABSENT (production never
# dispatches them), the spawn rewalk arm is replaced by the spawn's real surfaced
# edges, and instantiate topologies carry the per-host fold edges.
#
# Each fixture resolves a minimal topology and asserts its normalized delivery
# edge list. Scope id_hashes are normalized to "<kind>:<entityName>" so the
# expected lists stay readable and stable (the raw trace uses parent-blind
# id_hash identity, spec §8). Where a topology's full list is large but the
# mechanism under test is a small subset, the test asserts the exact subset for
# that mechanism plus the total edge count (noted inline).
#
# `just ci delivery-edges` runs this suite; `just ci delivery-edges.<test>` one
# test with traces.
